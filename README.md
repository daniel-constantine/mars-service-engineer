## Headlight Challenges - Mars Service Engineer

My submission to the Headlight Challenges.

My app would get the bots and mining nodes information from the API provided by [Headlight](https://docs.headlightlabs.com) team, and then use that data and display the location of the bots and the mining nodes in a grid format.

### How to use: 

```
git clone
cd mars-service-engineer
npm install
npm start
```

### Futures Update:

- Show transition when the bots are moving
- Show how much the prometheum remaining in each nodes
- Show the trail of the bots and how much prometheum the bots carried
